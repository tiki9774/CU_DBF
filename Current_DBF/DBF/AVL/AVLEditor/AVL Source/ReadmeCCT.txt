AVLCCT.exe is a modification of the opensource application AVL.  AVL is a vortex lattice analysis package written by Mark Drela: http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/avl/  This application is licensed under the GPL.  We have modified the original AVL application to output information in an xml format that our simulator can process.  According to the GPL license the source code for the modified application must be made available when we distribute the application.  Hence source for AVLCCT is included in this installation.
